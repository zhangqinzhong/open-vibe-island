/// Production implementation that advances Warp to its next tab by
/// clicking the `Tab ▸ Switch to Next Tab` menu item via the macOS
/// Accessibility API, not by synthesizing a Cmd+Shift+] key event.
///
/// Why not synthesize the keystroke? Two earlier attempts failed, both
/// because synthetic key events and physical key events are not
/// interchangeable on macOS:
///
/// 1. `CGEventPost(.cghidEventTap, ...)` silently produced NSBeep
///    without cycling tabs. Accessibility/HID filtering drops untrusted
///    synthetic events before they reach any app's keyEquivalent lookup.
/// 2. `tell application "System Events" to keystroke "]" using
///    {command down, shift down}` cycled exactly one tab on the very
///    first invocation after each fresh Accessibility grant, then
///    beeped on every subsequent call. The Apple Event boundary plus
///    the asynchronous WindowServer "frontmost app ↔ key window"
///    handoff creates a state where System Events' synthetic event
///    reaches Warp's process queue but does not walk the normal
///    NSWindow → responder chain → menu key-equivalent path, so the
///    `Next Tab` action never fires.
///
/// Clicking the menu item via AX side-steps all of that. The action
/// bound to the menu item runs directly, regardless of which Warp
/// window is key, which view is first responder, whether a TUI app
/// (claude) is running inside the focused pane, or whether modifier-key
/// state from a previous synthetic event is still "stuck". It is the
/// same dispatch path that fires when a user physically clicks the menu
/// with their mouse.
///
/// Menu path validated empirically against Warp Stable (April 2026):
///   menu bar → menu bar item "Tab" → menu "Tab" → menu item "Switch to Next Tab"
///
/// If a future Warp release renames the menu item or moves it to a
/// different submenu, this call will throw an AppleScript error which
/// is logged via NSLog; the bounded retry loop in
/// `TerminalJumpService.jumpToWarpPane` then caps out and falls back to
/// the "Activated Warp but could not confirm precision focus" message.
///
/// Permission: The Accessibility permission the user grants to the
/// Open Island host app authorizes `click menu item` on other
/// processes. Automation permission for `System Events` is also
/// required on the first call; macOS presents its standard consent
/// prompt.
