## Human Parts

*This section is written for humans.*

We welcome all good ideas. If you have the will, you can turn any idea into code for this project and have it used by others.

All code in this project is produced by AI. You should not contribute human-written code either.

### Getting Started

We've put effort into making it easy for AI to iterate on this project. To start contributing, paste the following into your code agent:

```
Please read this project's CONTRIBUTING.md and explain how I should iterate on this project.
Then list what you already know, such as release/build process, repo architecture, code conventions, PR standards, etc.
```

### Report a Bug via Your Code Agent

If you run into a problem, copy the prompt below into your code agent (Claude Code, Codex, etc.) and it will automatically collect environment info and create a well-structured issue for you.

```
I'm having an issue with Open Island (https://github.com/Octane0411/open-vibe-island).

Please help me file a GitHub issue. Do the following:

1. Collect my environment info:
   - Run `sw_vers` to get macOS version
   - Run `swift --version` to get Swift version
   - Check if Open Island is running: `ps aux | grep -i "open.island\|OpenIslandApp" | grep -v grep`
   - Get the app version: `defaults read ~/Applications/Open\ Island\ Dev.app/Contents/Info.plist CFBundleShortVersionString 2>/dev/null || echo "unknown"`
   - Check which terminal I'm using

2. Ask me to describe:
   - What I expected to happen
   - What actually happened
   - Steps to reproduce

3. Create the issue on GitHub using `gh issue create` with this format:
   - Title: concise summary
   - Body with sections: **Environment**, **Description**, **Steps to Reproduce**, **Expected vs Actual Behavior**
   - Add label "bug" if applicable

Repository: Octane0411/open-vibe-island
```

## Agent Parts

*This section is written for agents.*

### About the Project

Open Island is a native macOS companion app for AI coding agents. It sits in the notch/top-bar area and monitors local agent sessions, surfaces permission requests, answers questions, and provides "jump back" to the correct terminal context. Local-first, no server dependency.

**Supported agents**: Codex, Claude Code

**Supported terminals**: Terminal.app, Ghostty

### Prerequisites

- macOS 14+
- Swift 6.2+
- Xcode (for app target)

### Build & Test

```bash
# Build the project
swift build

# Run tests
swift test

# Run the app
swift run OpenIslandApp

# Build hook binary (release)
swift build -c release --product OpenIslandHooks
```

You can also open `Package.swift` in Xcode to build and run the app target directly.

### Where to Go Next

- [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) — Architecture, conventions, branching rules, commit policy, and release workflow.
- [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) — System design and engineering decisions.
- [`docs/product.md`](docs/product.md) — Product scope and MVP boundary.
- [`docs/hooks.md`](docs/hooks.md) — Supported hook events, payload fields, and directive protocol.
