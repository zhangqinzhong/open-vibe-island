# Create a local self-signed code signing identity for Open Island dev
# builds. One-time setup; idempotent on re-run.
#
# Why this exists
# ---------------
# Without a stable signing identity, `launch-dev-app.sh` ad-hoc signs
# the dev bundle with `codesign --sign -`, which produces a new cdhash
# every rebuild. macOS TCC tracks Accessibility (and other) permission
# grants for ad-hoc binaries by cdhash, so every `swift build` silently
# invalidates any grant the developer had previously approved. That
# makes iterating on features that require Accessibility permission —
# precision jump, keystroke injection, menu clicks — almost impossible
# without re-dragging the .app into System Settings → Privacy &
# Security → Accessibility every single iteration.
#
# With a real signing identity (even self-signed local), TCC tracks the
# grant by the certificate's designated requirement instead of cdhash.
# The cert doesn't change between rebuilds, so the permission persists.
#
# What this script does
# ---------------------
# 1. Generates an RSA 2048, 10-year, Code-Signing-EKU self-signed cert
#    via openssl.
# 2. Imports the cert + private key into the login keychain, with the
#    key ACL set so /usr/bin/codesign can use it non-interactively.
# 3. Adds a user-level Code Signing trust override so the identity
#    shows up as valid in `security find-identity -p codesigning -v`.
#
# The cert is scoped to the developer's login keychain, never touches
# the system keychain, and requires no sudo.
#
# What to do with it
# ------------------
# After running this once, `launch-dev-app.sh` auto-detects the
# identity and uses it. On the first run after signing, you still have
# to grant Accessibility once (System Settings → Privacy & Security
# → Accessibility → drag the .app from ~/Applications/ into the
# list). From that grant onwards, permission persists across rebuilds.
#
# To undo: `security delete-identity -Z <sha1> ~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain-db`
# where <sha1> is from `security find-identity -p codesigning -v`. Also
# `security remove-trusted-cert <cert.pem>` if you want the trust
# override gone.
