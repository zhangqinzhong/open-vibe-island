## What is Open Island?

Open Island sits in your Mac's **notch** (or top bar) and gives you a real-time control surface for your AI coding agents — session status, permission approvals, and instant jump-back to the right terminal. All without leaving your flow.

Think of it as an open-source [Vibe Island](https://vibeisland.app/) — **free, local-first, and you own every bit of it**.

> *You don't need to pay for a product you can vibe, since you are a vibe coder.*

## Why Open Island?

- **Open source** — GPL v3, fork it, mod it, ship your own version
- **Local-first** — No server, no telemetry, no account. Everything runs on your Mac
- **Native macOS** — SwiftUI + AppKit, not an Electron wrapper
- **Multi-agent** — One surface for Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, OpenCode, and more
- **Multi-terminal** — Jump back to the exact terminal/IDE session in one click

## Supported Agents & Terminals

**8 agents**: Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, OpenCode, Qoder, Qwen Code, Factory, CodeBuddy

**14+ terminals & IDEs**: Terminal.app, Ghostty, iTerm2, WezTerm, Zellij, cmux, Kaku, VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Trae, JetBrains IDEs (IDEA, WebStorm, PyCharm, GoLand, CLion, RubyMine, PhpStorm, Rider, RustRover)

</details>

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Download

Grab the latest DMG from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Octane0411/open-vibe-island/releases) — signed and notarized, ready to run.

### Option 2: Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Octane0411/open-vibe-island.git
cd open-vibe-island
open Package.swift   # Opens in Xcode — hit Run
```

On first launch, Open Island auto-discovers your active agent sessions and starts the live bridge. Hook installation is managed from the **Control Center** inside the app.

> **Requirements**: macOS 14+, Swift 6.2, Xcode

## How It Works

```
Agent (Claude Code / Codex / Cursor / ...)
  ↓ hook event
OpenIslandHooks CLI (stdin → Unix socket)
  ↓ JSON envelope
BridgeServer (in-app)
  ↓ state update
Notch overlay UI ← you see it here
  ↓ click
Jump back → correct terminal / IDE
```

Hooks **fail open** — if Open Island isn't running, your agents continue unaffected.

## Agent Parts

This section is written for agents.

The open-source macOS companion for terminal-native AI coding.

`Open Island` puts a lightweight control surface in your notch or top bar so you can keep an eye on live coding agents, follow session progress, and jump back to the right terminal without breaking flow.

### Why This Product Exists

AI coding is becoming part of the daily development loop, but the surrounding control layer still too often means handing your machine over to a closed-source paid app.

`Open Island` takes the opposite approach:

- Open source
- Local first, no server dependency
- Native macOS (SwiftUI + AppKit)
- Built to support the terminal workflow, not replace it

### Who It Is For

Developers who already live in the terminal and want a better way to work with coding agents on macOS without losing context.

### Agent Integrations

- **Codex** — Full hook-based integration. Receives `SessionStart`, `UserPromptSubmit`, and `Stop` events by default. Reads 5-hour and 7-day account usage windows from local rollout files. Install/uninstall managed hooks from the control center or CLI.
- **Claude Code** — Hook-based integration via `~/.claude/settings.json`. Discovers sessions from `~/.claude/projects/` JSONL transcripts. Persists and restores sessions across app launches. Managed status line bridge with opt-in installation. Reads cached 5-hour and 7-day usage windows.
- **OpenCode** — JS plugin integration via `~/.config/opencode/plugins/`. Plugin auto-installed on first launch. Receives session lifecycle, tool use, permission, and question events. Permission approval and question answering flows supported. Process detection via `ps`.
- **Qoder** — Claude Code fork. Same hook format and events via `~/.qoder/settings.json`. Use `--source qoder` with the hooks binary.
- **Qwen Code** — Claude Code fork. Same hook format and events via `~/.qwen/settings.json`. Use `--source qwen` with the hooks binary.
- **Factory** — Claude Code fork. Same hook format and events via `~/.factory/settings.json`. Use `--source factory` with the hooks binary.
- **CodeBuddy** — Claude Code fork. Same hook format and events via `~/.codebuddy/settings.json`. Use `--source codebuddy` with the hooks binary.
- **Cursor** — Hook-based integration via `~/.cursor/hooks.json`. Receives `beforeSubmitPrompt`, `beforeShellExecution`, `beforeMCPExecution`, `beforeReadFile`, `afterFileEdit`, and `stop` events. Session persistence across app launches. Workspace jump-back via `cursor -r`. Use `--source cursor` with the hooks binary.

### Terminal Support

- **Terminal.app**, **Ghostty**, **cmux**, **Kaku**, **WezTerm**, **iTerm2**, and **Zellij** — Full jump-back support with session attachment matching (cmux via Unix socket API, Kaku/WezTerm/Zellij via CLI pane targeting, iTerm2 via AppleScript session/TTY probe)
- **VS Code**, **VS Code Insiders**, **Cursor**, **Windsurf**, **Trae** — Workspace-level jump via respective CLI (`code -r`, `cursor -r`, etc.)
- **JetBrains IDEs** (IntelliJ IDEA, WebStorm, PyCharm, GoLand, CLion, RubyMine, PhpStorm, Rider, RustRover) — Workspace-level jump via IDE CLI launcher
- **Warp** — Fallback detection and basic process discovery

### UI & Display

- **Notch overlay** — On Macs with a built-in notch, the island sits in the notch area; on external displays or non-notch Macs, it falls back to a compact top-center bar
- **Control center** — Codex/Claude hook status, usage dashboard, debug scenarios
- **Settings** — General, Display, Sound, Shortcuts, Lab (advanced), About
- **Notification mode** — Auto-height notification panel for permission requests and session events
- **Notification sounds** — Configurable system sounds (default: Bottle) with mute toggle
- **i18n** — English and Simplified Chinese

### Session Management

- Live session visibility with expandable detail rows
- Session state reducer (`SessionState.apply`) as single source of truth
- Automatic session discovery from local transcript files and cache
- Process discovery via `ps`/`lsof` for active agent matching

### Architecture

Four targets in one Swift package:

| Target | Role |
|---|---|
| **OpenIslandApp** | SwiftUI + AppKit shell — menu bar, overlay panel, control center, settings |
| **OpenIslandCore** | Shared library — models, bridge transport (Unix socket IPC), hooks, session persistence |
| **OpenIslandHooks** | Lightweight CLI invoked by agent hooks, forwards payloads via Unix socket |
| **OpenIslandSetup** | Installer CLI for managing `~/.codex/config.toml` and hook entries |

### Quick Start (Agent)

Build and run locally:

```bash
open Package.swift
```

Build a local `.app` bundle:

```bash
zsh scripts/package-app.sh
```

That script creates `output/package/Open Island.app` and `output/package/Open Island.zip`. Pass `OPEN_ISLAND_SIGN_IDENTITY` to sign the bundle. See [docs/packaging.md](docs/packaging.md) for the full path, including notarization.

#### Connect Codex

Open the package in Xcode to run the macOS app target. On launch, the app restores its local cache, scans recent `~/.codex/sessions/**/rollout-*.jsonl` files for existing Codex sessions, and starts the live bridge for new hook events.

The control center shows live Codex hook install status from `~/.codex`, and can install or uninstall managed hook entries directly. Installs copy the helper into `~/Library/Application Support/OpenIsland/bin/OpenIslandHooks` so repo renames do not break existing hooks.

```bash
swift build -c release --product OpenIslandHooks
swift run OpenIslandSetup install
swift run OpenIslandSetup status
swift run OpenIslandSetup uninstall
```

#### Connect Claude Code

Claude usage setup is available from the app's control center and remains opt-in. The bridge writes a managed `statusLine.command` to `~/.open-island/bin/open-island-statusline`, caches `rate_limits` into `/tmp/open-island-rl.json`, and refuses to overwrite an existing custom status line automatically.

### Repository Map

- Start with [docs/index.md](docs/index.md) for the current doc map.
- Read [docs/quality.md](docs/quality.md) for the quality baseline and verification approach.
- Read [docs/hooks.md](docs/hooks.md) for all supported hook events, payload fields, and directive response formats.
- Run `scripts/harness.sh` for automated checks (docs validation, tests, build).

### Requirements

- macOS 14+
- Swift 6.2
- Xcode (for the app target)
